# Regxr

Regxr is a minimal, lightweight and beautiful MacOS desktop application that allows for easy checking of regular expression pattern matching.

### Features
- Syntax highlighting
- Dark and light modes
- Minimal and simple to use
- Live preview of multiple pattern matches 
- Full screeen support
- Reference manual

I have also developed a [menubar application](https://github.com/lukakerr/regxr-menubar) that does the same thing, but lives in the menubar.
